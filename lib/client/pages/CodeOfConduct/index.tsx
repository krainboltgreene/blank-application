      Our Pledge
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as Card Game pledge to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. Our goal is to make nail polish open to everyone. These guidelines allow us to ensure that all nail polish enthusiasts feel safe and welcome to share their art and express themselves without fear.
    </p>

    <h2>

      Our Responsibilities
    </h2>
    <p>
      We are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
      We have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any Lacquerista for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
    </p>

    <p>
      As community members, you have the ability to hold us accountable to these responsibilities. We will be available for contact at any given time and hold ourselves responsible to responding to the use of our reporting tools in a timely and respectful manner.

    <h2>
      Scope
    </h2>
    <p>
      This Code of Conduct applies both within the community and in public spaces when an individual is representing Card Game or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. We reserve the right to redefine and clarify what representation means for Card Game in the future.
